In today's world there are many advancement in the technology field specifically in software development.
I am now attending computer science class where we studying C language. 
I am not very experience in software development but it has been always a great passion for me that I started learning Python programming language as it is high-level-programming language,
however, it is a new challenge for me learn about C language where I am currently attending a class for it to learn more about lower-level-programming language. 
I feel really excited to start to learn the basics of computer science how computers operates. 
There are a lot to learn in computer science field and I feel really humble whenever I started to learn a new thing which makes me more passionate and curios. 
I am getting better everyday by practice and I have seen my older brother working in C before and how he can operate everything from Linux system where I do not have an experience in it but I am so looking forward to be a professional in it. 
I have seen many developer do not depend on using the mouse whenever they are working on their computer and now I do understand why was that behavior.
It is because using UNIX and Linux depends heavily on using hands on keyboards to work more efficient and faster. 
I am on my way to learn using keyboard more than mouse and learning about C and Linux operating system will defiantly help me develop that habit. 
I am looking forward to see where I can go with building such a skill to use Linux operating system, especially for cyber security purposes where using Linux is more secure than any other operating system.
It could secure your files in a robust form and keep your work much more professional when it comes to computers and software development.
